Membership is on an annual basis (January to December). Dues are $25<br />    a year which include coaching and a racing jersey or other team item. We train together weekly (not a requirement to be a member), represent<br />    Team Utopia at local and out-of-area team competitions, volunteer at local races throughout the year, and give members an opportunity to socialize<br />    and meet other runners. We encourage every member to join USA Track and Field (www.usatf.com) to be eligible to join other Team Utopia<br />    members in USATF team competitions.
